I spend most of my time writing code, reading about linguistics and botany, and quietly wondering how things work — or why they don’t.

Not big on noise. Prefer clear systems, quiet places, and ideas that actually hold up under pressure.

This site is where I park some thoughts and projects. Nothing too formal.
